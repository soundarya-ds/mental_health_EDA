# Exploratory Data Analysis on Mental Health Prevalence

## 📊 Project Overview
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of global mental health prevalence using the `mental-illnesses-prevalence.csv` dataset from Kaggle.  
The goal is to identify trends and patterns across different mental health conditions over time and across countries.

## 🧠 Objectives
- Explore how the prevalence of mental illnesses has changed over time.
- Compare trends of different mental health conditions (e.g., depression vs anxiety).
- Identify countries with high prevalence of certain mental disorders.
- Understand relationships between different disorders.

## 🗂 Dataset
The dataset used:
- `mental-illnesses-prevalence.csv`
It contains country‑level data on the share of the population affected by various mental health disorders over multiple years.

Source: Kaggle mental health dataset.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📌 Notebook Content
The Jupyter notebook includes:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Trend visualization for mental health conditions  
3. Comparison plots (e.g., Depression vs Anxiety)  
4. Bar charts for top countries  
5. Histograms showing distribution  
6. Correlation heatmap between disorders  
7. Insights and interpretation of results

## 📈 Visualizations & Insights
Each visualization is accompanied by a short explanation highlighting:
- Key patterns in the data  
- Observed trends over time  
- Important insights that relate to mental health prevalence

## 📝 Key Findings
- Global depression prevalence has shown notable trends over time.
- Depression and anxiety often follow similar patterns.
- Some countries have higher prevalence than others, indicating possible socio‑economic or healthcare influences.
- Strong positive correlation between certain disorders, especially depression and anxiety.
